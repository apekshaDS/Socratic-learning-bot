# Socratic-learning-bot
The Socratic Learning Bot is an AI-powered teaching assistant designed to engage students in a more thoughtful and interactive way, inspired by the Socratic method. Rather than simply providing answers, the bot encourages critical thinking by asking insightful questions and guiding learners through problem-solving processes. Focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), the bot helps students tackle challenging topics like sorting algorithms, trees, and graph theory. Along the way, it offers multiple hints and gradually nudges students toward the correct solution, fostering a deeper understanding of the material. The bot creates a personalized learning experience, adapting to each student's pace and needs, making the journey of mastering complex concepts more intuitive, engaging, and effective. Ultimately, the goal is to not only help students arrive at the right answers but to cultivate their ability to think critically and solve problems independently.
